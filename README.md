# vunlp_old
System to delegate NLP-parsing of texts to a supercomputer. Created to
be implemented for scientists of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, to
use the power of the
[Lisa computer cluster](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/lisa-compute-cluster/index.html),
without having to deal with Lisa directly.

This is an older system, based on Bash scripts. It is superseded by
Python-based approaches that can be found in
[vunlp-middle](https://github.com/PaulHuygen/vunlp-middle) and 
[vunlp-client-nuweb](https://github.com/PaulHuygen/vunlp-client-nuweb).
