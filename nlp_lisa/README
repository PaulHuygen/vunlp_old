This directory contains the source-code of nlp_lisa.

Nlp-lisa is part of a service with which scientists of the VU-university
can parse texts with NLP parsers on the Lisa supercomputer. It is the
part that runs on Lisa.

The project has been written in "literate programming" style using
nuweb (http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/). As a result, complete
documentation of the code, with instruction about how to compile it,
can be found in alpinist.pdf.
